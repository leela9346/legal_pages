<p>Termination by You. You may cancel your account at any time by emailing us at LEGAL@VINN.AI. Your cancellation will be effective immediately, and you will not be charged again.</p>
<p>Termination by Us. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Vinn.AI immediately and without notice if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms or pose a risk to the service, other users, or us.</p>
<p> Effect of Termination--------- Upon any termination, your right to access and use Vinn.AI will stop immediately.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you export your data regularly. We will provide a 15-day grace period after termination for you to request a final export of your data. After this period, we may permanently delete your data.</p>
<p>You remain responsible for any fees incurred before termination. All fees are final and non-refundable as per our refund policy.</p>
<p>Survival. The parts of these Terms that are meant to continue will survive termination. This includes sections on your responsibilities, fees, intellectual property, and limits of our liability.</p>

<h3>6. FEE & PAYMENT</h3>
<p>Paid Services. Certain Vinn.AI services require payment of a fee. You will only be charged for the services you choose to use.</p>
<p>Accurate Information. You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate payment and account information and to promptly update this information (such as a new credit card number or expiration date) so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.</p>
<p>Authorization for Payment.

For one-time purchases, you authorize us to charge your chosen payment method immediately.</p>

<p>For subscription services, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis until you cancel. You can cancel at any time to stop future charges.</p>

<p>No Refunds. All fees are final and non-refundable, except where required by law</p>

<h3>7. SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION</h3>
<p>How to Cancel. You may cancel your subscription at any time, either directly through your account settings or by contacting us at SUPPORT@VINN.AI.</p>

<p>No Refunds. All payments are final. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month use, unused time, or if you cancel your subscription mid-billing period.</p>

<h3>8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>

<p>Clear Ownership Declaration: It starts by unequivocally stating that everything about the service (the IP) is Vinn.AI's property. This is the foundation of the entire clause.</p>
<p>Broad Scope of Protection: It lists specific protected elements (software, design, text, images, logos) and crucially uses the phrase "including... but not limited to," which legally covers everything else. The mention of "underlying technology" is also very important.</p>
<p>Specific Carve-Outs: It wisely excludes "User Content and third-party AI models," which prevents potential disputes over who owns what</p>
<p>Restrictive License: The license granted to the user is perfectly defined for company protection:</p>

<p>Limited: Not full ownership.</p>

<p>Non-exclusive: Vinn.AI can grant it to others.</p>

<p>Non-transferable: The user can't give it to someone else.</p>

<p>Revocable: Vinn.AI can take it away at any time (e.g., upon termination).</p>
